# Notebooks

**Age distribution**
*- quickly remind of the distributions of each genotypic group*


**Creating hand-drawn ROIs**
*- how to defined ROIs over supra-threshold clusters using manually drawn regions*

**SPM**
*- a bunch of notebooks about design matrices, and exploration of SPM results*

  > ***Exploring results - Initial models with quadratic age x genotype interaction***
  > *- first tested models with initial data (normalized using ANTs - with
  > registration imprecisions in the ventricular area). Also raised questions about
  > the interest of quadratic modeling.*
  >
  > ***Building design matrices***
  > *- a few notebooks to create Excel tables with SPM regressors*
  >
  > ***Analyses - Linear, quadratic, FA, MD***
  > *- testing more models*
  >
  > ***Exploring results - Extra models e.g. using linear age***
  > *- comparing models (linear vs quadratic etc)*
  >
  > ***DARTEL***
  > *- exploring results using DARTEL-normalized DWI maps

**ROI analyses**
*- plotting work on ROI values extracted from various sets of images

**Tools**
*- testing various tools using notebooks*

**Effect of ventricles**
*- some work focused on the effect of ventricles that showed the impact of
registration errors in this region*

**Python for science BBRC**
*- a few notebooks prepared for the introductory course at BarcelonaBeta
